      Create a contract to issue a collection of NFTs, where each NFT represents a car. On the website, by default, 
      each user's cars can be borrowed. Each user can: view their own list of owned cars, view the list of cars currently not borrowed, 
      query the owner of a car, and the current borrower of the car (if any). Choose and borrow a car that hasn't been borrowed for a certain period. 
      Complete the process of paying for car rental using their own issued points (ERC20).
