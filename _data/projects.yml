  name: AI Image Captioning Bot
  github: Kajal03/AI-Image-Captioning-Bot
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    A Deep Learning model for Image Captioning, wherein the bot takes an image from the user and generates
    captions describing it.
    For easy access, the system is deployed as a Flask Web Application
    The model uses transfer learning to extract features from an image which are further used by LSTM layers
    to generate captions.
