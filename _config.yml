 <br><br> Hi, I recently completed my MSc. Computer Science from Department of Computer Science, University of Delhi.<br>Currently I'm an intern at Accolite Digital. I love to code and solve algorithmic challenges. I am also interested in Web Development and Machine Learning.<br> If you are interested, you can view some of my favorite projects in my portfolio down below.

  When I am not coding I am very active and spend most of my time outdoors. I enjoy swimming and roller skating. As I like to be creative, I try to   	make time for painting.
